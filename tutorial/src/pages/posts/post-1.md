## Step-by-Step Cooking Instructions

### Prep the Ingredients
1. Dice the pancetta (or guanciale) into small pieces.  
2. Finely grate the cheese.  
3. Whisk together 2 whole eggs plus 1 additional yolk in a small bowl. Stir in about half of the cheese. Set aside.

### Cook the Pasta
1. Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil (use roughly 1 tablespoon of salt for every 4–5 quarts of water).  
2. Add the spaghetti and cook until al dente, following the package instructions.

### Render the Pancetta
1. While the pasta cooks, set a large skillet over medium heat and add the diced pancetta (no extra oil is needed if you’re using a fatty cut).  
2. Cook for about 5–7 minutes, stirring occasionally, until the fat is rendered out and the meat becomes crispy.  
3. Turn off the heat once the pancetta is cooked. (If there’s a lot of excess fat, spoon some out—though leaving a bit in the pan is beneficial for flavor.)

### Combine Pasta & Sauce
1. When the spaghetti is ready, reserve about 1 cup of the hot pasta water, then drain the pasta.  
2. Transfer the pasta directly into the skillet with the pancetta (heat off).  
3. Immediately pour in the whisked eggs and cheese mixture, tossing quickly.  
4. **Important:** Add a splash of the reserved pasta water as needed. The hot pasta (plus a bit of hot water) will gently cook the eggs, creating a creamy sauce.  
5. Season with freshly ground black pepper.  
6. If the sauce looks too thick, add more pasta water, a little at a time, until it’s silky.  
7. Taste and adjust salt and pepper if needed.

### Serve & Garnish
1. Divide into bowls and sprinkle generously with the remaining grated Pecorino Romano.  
2. Add another crack of black pepper on top for a finishing touch.

## Tips & Tricks
- **Don’t Overcook the Eggs**: The biggest pitfall is scrambling the eggs. Ensure you remove the skillet from the heat before mixing in the egg and cheese mixture. Use the residual heat of the pan and the hot spaghetti to cook the sauce gently.  
- **Reserve Enough Pasta Water**: This starchy water helps achieve that luxurious, glossy texture. If the sauce starts drying out, a spoonful of water can bring it back to life.  
- **Use Freshly Grated Cheese**: Pre-grated cheese often includes anti-caking agents, which can affect the sauce’s texture.  
- **Experiment with Ratios**: Some people prefer an extra egg yolk for more richness, while others like a bit more cheese or pancetta. Adapt it to your taste!
