## Step-by-Step Cooking Instructions

### Prep the Pasta
1. Preheat the oven to 375°F (190°C).  
2. Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil.  
3. Add the elbow macaroni and cook until al dente, following the package instructions (typically around 7–8 minutes).  
4. Drain and set aside.

### Make the Cheese Sauce
1. In a medium saucepan, melt the butter over medium heat.  
2. Whisk in the flour, stirring constantly for about 1 minute to cook out the raw flour taste.  
3. Gradually pour in the milk, whisking continuously to prevent lumps.  
4. Keep stirring until the mixture thickens to a creamy consistency (about 5 minutes).  
5. Lower the heat and stir in 2 cups of cheddar cheese (reserve the remaining cheddar for topping). If you’re adding Gruyère, stir that in as well.  
6. Season with salt and pepper to taste.

### Combine & Assemble
1. In a large bowl (or directly in a baking dish if it’s big enough), combine the cooked macaroni with the cheese sauce.  
2. Transfer everything to a lightly greased 9x13-inch baking dish.  
3. Sprinkle the reserved 1 cup of cheddar on top (plus breadcrumbs if you’re using them).

### Bake
1. Place the dish in the preheated oven.  
2. Bake for about 20–25 minutes, or until the top is bubbly and golden brown.  
3. If you like an extra-crispy top, switch the oven to broil for the last 2–3 minutes—just keep a close eye to avoid burning.

### Serve
1. Remove from the oven and let it rest for about 5 minutes to set.  
2. Scoop into bowls or plates and enjoy the creamy, cheesy comfort.

## Tips & Tricks
- **Undercook Your Pasta Slightly**: If you know you’ll be baking it further, cook the macaroni just shy of al dente so it doesn’t turn mushy in the oven.  
- **Mix Up the Cheeses**: Feel free to swap in other melty cheeses, like pepper Jack for a kick, or smoked gouda for a twist.  
- **Watch the Roux**: Stir the flour and butter (roux) constantly. Overcooking it can lead to a darker sauce; undercooking may taste “floury.”  
- **Make It a Meal**: Toss in cooked bacon, chopped broccoli, or sautéed onions to add protein and veggies.
